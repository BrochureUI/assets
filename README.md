# sch.assets

- This is a container of all front-side static files, CSS, Favicons and what shall come next.

- All [**`Scheme`**](https://github.com/rhman-ibrahim/rhman-ibrahim#scheme) projects will have some or all of the files contained here.

- *sch.assets* will be continuously updated to encompass all static files related to general CSS files needed.

## Favicons

- a list of default image favicons files of different sizes: 16. 32, 192 amd 512, all are PNG files.

## Reset

- [**`Scheme`**](https://github.com/rhman-ibrahim/rhman-ibrahim#scheme) uses the reset style sheet of [Meyer Web](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), thanks to those who worked on this file and sharing it with public is a respectful contribution to the industry.

## Font

- [**`Scheme`**](https://github.com/rhman-ibrahim/rhman-ibrahim#scheme) uses [Ubuntu font](https://design.ubuntu.com/font), thanks to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) one of the greatest organizations in the software industry and its the first Linux distro I learnt and used, that's why I feel belonged too and always choose to use. The `.ttf` files are contained in `public/fonts` directory.

- [**`Scheme`**](https://github.com/rhman-ibrahim/rhman-ibrahim#scheme) has [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) installed in `public/fontawesome/css` but for icons the system relies on [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) mainly, so having both will cover the need of delivering most of icons, thanks to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for their great work.

## Master

- The `Master.css` will add more reset and general rules, all defined as CSS variables.

## Theme

- [**`Scheme`**](https://github.com/rhman-ibrahim/rhman-ibrahim#scheme) has a default `dark` and `light` modes with accent colors and alert colors.

- By default the theme is set to `dark` mode. Each mode consists of 5 color degrees.

- 4 alert colors for `danger`, `warning`, `info` and `success` each has 2 degrees (dark & light).
